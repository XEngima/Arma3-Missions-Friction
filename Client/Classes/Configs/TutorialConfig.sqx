This information is also available in the briefing.\n\nREAD THE BRIEFING\nWhen you start a mission, make sure you read the briefing and the task information carefully.\n\nBASE LAYOUT\nThe base contains a respawn point (where you start), a weapon depot (where weapons and ammo spawns), a land vehicles area (where land vehicles spawn) and a naval vehicles area (where boats spawn).\n\nMISSION INSERTION\nIn the beginning of each mission your squad will be inserted into the action area to begin carrying out the mission. Most often you will start the mission by doing a manual insertion. Use the action menu. Select 'Mission Menu' and then 'Perform Insertion' which will bring up the map over the insertion area. Then left click in one of the blue insertion areas. Your squad will be inserted immediately, so make sure everyone is ready. In some missions you will start the mission in your base. In these cases the insertion will occur automatically.\n\nREMEMBER TO BRING ALL YOU NEED!\nDo not forget to bring explosives if you are to blow anything up! And make sure to bring a vehicle if there will be travel distances. If you want to bring a vehicle then first enter it and perform the insertion inside it.\n\nSCORE\nA succeeded primary objective will earn 100 points for your side. A secondary objective 50 points, and a return objective 50 points. You will lose 25 points for each lost team member during a mission, and recieve a bonus of 50 points if everyone survive a successful mission. The side with the highest total score when the campaign ends will win."
