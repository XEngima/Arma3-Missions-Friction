The insertion area may be your own base, in which case the insertion will happen automatically. But otherwise (and probably most often) you will start the mission by doing a manual insertion. In the latter case you use the action menu. Select 'Mission Menu' and then 'Perform Insertion'. The map will open, and when you click in one of the blue insertion areas, your squad will be inserted immediately, so make sure everyone is ready.\n\nREMEMBER TO BRING ALL YOU NEED!\nDo not forget to bring explosives if you are to blow anything up! And make sure to bring a vehicle if there will be travel distances. If you want to bring a vehicle then first enter it and perform the insertion inside it.\n\nSCORE\nA succeeded primary objective will earn 100 points for your side. A secondary objective 50 points, and a return objective 50 points. You will lose 40 points for each lost team member during a mission, and recieve a bonus of 50 points if everyone survive a successful mission. The side with the highest total score when the campaign ends will win."
