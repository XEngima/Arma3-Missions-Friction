 * Description:
 * This file/class has a single purpose to select a campaign for the campaign engine.
 * Organized in this way, and while this file will not be subject to change in future TvTCF CPacks, you can change this file to 
 * start a custom campaign, without it interfering with new CPack versions of the TvTCF framework.
